# Flappy Bird

This game is me introducing myself to a little bit of JavaScript game development. This is a very simple remake of the popular phone app Flappy Bird.

The game is run on a canvas within an HTML page. JavaScript does all of the drawing and calculations. This was a first step towards creating a Flappy Bird phone app on Amazon Studios. I think now that I know how all the math works, I can focus on understanding the software rather than the issues with the code.

I started the game using one rectangle for the bird. Once the game mechanics were all finished, I decided to break down the bird into individual rectangle to make collision exact. This was a long process but in the end was worth it. I am not sure how to do rotation now. It was difficult with one image before, now it is for 12 that have to fit perfectly together otherwise there will be noticeable gaps in the image. I will learn how to do this in the future.

The goal of this game is to fly for as long as possible. As you play the game, the wall speed increases making the game more difficult.
