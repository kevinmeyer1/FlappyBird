# Flappy Bird
This game is me introducing myself to a little bit of JavaScript game development. This is a very simple remake of the popular phone app Flappy Bird.

The game is run on a canvas within an HTML page. JavaScript does all of the drawing and calculations. This was a first step towards creating a Flappy Bird phone app on Amazon Studios. I think now that I know how all the math works, I can focus on understanding the software rather than the issues with the code.

The goal of this game is to fly for as long as possible. As you play the game, the wall speed increases making the game more difficult. The hitbox of the bird is slightly off. I may come back to this and try to break down the bird into its individual rectangles so collision is more precise.
